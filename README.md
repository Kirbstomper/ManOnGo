# Man On The Go Companian Repo

This repository contains the code used in my "Man On the Go" Tech On Tap presentation. Provided so that if you are new to go you can have something real simple to poke around in.

# Building and Running Demo Service

You can build the application using
`go build`

You can then run it
`./ManOnGo`

You can send requests to 'localhost:8080/fizzbuzz'

request body is just text containing the number you wish to fizzbuzz

# Running Tests

You can run tests using 
`go test`

# Viewing Documentation

You can view documentation by using the `godoc` tool

`godoc -http=:6060` will deploy the documentation at localhost:6060 to view
